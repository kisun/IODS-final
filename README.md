## Introduction to Open Data Science

The course name is **Introduction to Open Data Science, autumn 2017 (IODS17)** and has been organized for a second time. Most importantly, the course has been made available via University of Helsinki's [MOOC platform](https://mooc.helsinki.fi). The mooc page for IODS is [here](https://mooc.helsinki.fi/course/view.php?id=92). I have prepared a github page for the final project of this course and you can also find the link to my learning diary [here](https://kisun.github.io/IODS-final/).
